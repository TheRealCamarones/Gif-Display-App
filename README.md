# Gif-Display-App

An assignment for the UNC Charlotte Coding Bootcamp.

Create an app to display Gifs to the user. The user will click a button related to a topic of their choice and then the app will display ten gifs in a grid across the screen. The rating will be displayed underneath each gif and they will animate or reset when clicked. If the user doesn't find a button they like they will be able to enter a new value and create a new button.

This assignment emphasizes the link to the Giphy API to access the gifs. Then I used jQuery to dynamically create and hide elements on the page to display the gifs.
